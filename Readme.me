# 🏠 House Price Prediction

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict housing prices using various regression models on structured data.

## 📌 Highlights
- Preprocessing & feature engineering
- Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models
- Evaluation using RMSE
- Visualization of prediction performance

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Power BI (for visualization if used)
- Jupyter Notebook / Kaggle

## 🧠 Results
- Best model achieved RMSE ≈ **27,897**
- Gradient Boosting & Ridge performed best
- Key predictors: Overall Quality, Living Area, Basement Size

## 📁 Files
- `house-price-final.ipynb`: The notebook with all steps and results
